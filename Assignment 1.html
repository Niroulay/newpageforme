Fruits are important sources of vitamins and carbohydrates like fiber and sugar. They are low in calories and naturally sweet. Fruits and their juices are good sources of water, too. 
Different fruits contain different vitamins, so it is important to eat a variety of fruits.Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't.
A pomegranate can hold up to 1400 seeds.Cranberries can bounce.A pumpkin is a fruit.Potatoes were the first vegetable to be grown in space.

Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves (/ˈeɪviːz/), characterised 
by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate,
 a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size 
 from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) ostrich. There are about ten 
 thousand living species, more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have
wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings 
are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the 
ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites,
penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds
 are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly 
seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming.

A film also called a movie, motion picture, moving picture, picture or photoplay  is a work of visual art 
that simulates experiences and otherwise communicates ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or 
atmosphere through the use of moving images. These images are generally accompanied by sound and, more 
rarely, other sensory stimulations.[1] The word "cinema", short for cinematography, is often used to
 refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and to the art form that is the result of it.

Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food. The original meaning is
still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter, including
the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. An alternative definition of the term is applied 
somewhat arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some 
plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains, but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes 
and courgettes, flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.

Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. 
With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, 
can reproduce sexually, and go through an ontogenetic stage in which their body consists of a hollow 
sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species
 have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 
 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) 
 to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, 
 forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology.

A country is a distinct part of the world, such as a state, nation, or other political entity. 
It may be a sovereign state or make up one part of a larger state.[1] For example, the country of Japan is 
an independent, sovereign state, while the country of Wales is a component of a multi-part sovereign state,
 the United Kingdom. A country may be a non-sovereign or historically sovereign political division
(such as Korea), a physical territory with a government (such as Senegal), or a geographic region
associated with certain distinct political, ethnic, or cultural characteristics
 (such as the Basque Country).
